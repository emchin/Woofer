*First: create a .txt file and use the provided code to raise a popup when it is "found" vs. "not found". Use "Inspect" to check if there are any bugs in the code!
  -->Troubleshooting: if it doesn't work, look more closely into the starting directory: does Profile work, or file path, or other?
  -->Troubleshooting: check if I/O works on all OS
*Then: try to add data to the aforementioned .txt file using the "append" flag.
  -->Troubleshooting: try without append?
  -->Troubleshooting: try adding one file line at a time, instead of a huge mass of text.
*After that: try to read the data from the .txt file
*THEN: SUCCESS!!! :D*
